          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <b> Poverty Correlations</b>
          <p>Poverty and obesity have a postive correlation, signifying that the greater the percentage of poverty the greater the percentage of obesity. 
            Poverty and smoking also has a positive relationship, in that the greater the percentage of poverty the greate the percentage of smokes will likely be.
          Poverty and lack of healthcare are strongly, positively related as well. Thus, those below the poverty line have a greater chance of developing bad behavioural habits, 
        such as obesity and smoking. Also because of living in poverty they are more likely to lack the means to afford healthcare.</p>
            <b> Age Correlations</b>
          <p>Age and obesity have somewhat of a positive relationship, however most of the points do tend to congregate towards the middle of the plot indicating a weaker correlation
            between median age and percent obesity. Age and smoking have a slightly stronger positive relationship signifying that as people get older they tend to smoke more. Age and lack of healthcare
          has a negative correlation meaning that as people age they tend to have more healthcare. This makes sense considering that older people tend to utilize the benefits of their healthcare
        with more frequency due to their more fragile state when compared to those who are younger.</p>
            <b> Income Correlations</b>
          <p>Household income and obesity have a negative correlation, the greater the income the more likely that obesity will be less. Healthy food options are often
            more expensive than cheap meals, such as drive thru meals therefore those with smaller income may choose to consume cheaper, unhealthy options. Income and smoking also 
            has a negative relationship. Household income and lacking healthcare tend to be negatively correlated as well, signifying that those with lower income tend to have a greater chance
            of not having healthcare.
